# RegistryDataProject
This python program finds matches between two massive UC-employee databases and merges their data together


Download database files useragent.timelapse_table and university-of-california-2017O
Once downloaded, change file path names for both files towards the beginning of the code to the pathname for your local files
More adjustment would be needed to parsing and indices, but this code could be adapted for other databases
